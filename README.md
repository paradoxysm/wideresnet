This repository serves as a template repository for any python package development destined for PyPi. As a GitHub Template Repository, it can easily be cloned into a new repository for your own use. The repository contains:
 - A skeleton for the README.md (which you're reading right now!)
 - A simple `setup.py` file
 - Testing with `pytest` ready to go
 - Automated testing and deployment through TravisCI
 - Code maintainability and test coverage through CodeClimate
 - GitHub Issues/PR templates

Do remember to change all references to `pypkg` to the name of your python package! These references are located in the following locations:
 - Here...
 - docs/README.md
 - setup.py
 - pytest.ini
 - pypkg/ (rename to the name of your package)

## Installation

```
> `pypkg` is tested and supported on Python 3.5 up to Python 3.8. Usage on other versions of Python is not guaranteed to work as intended.
